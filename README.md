## Password Generator Oh Yeah

**List of Technologies Used:**

2. CSS

**What the app is:**

To create a random password generator based on selection of characters the user wants in their password. 

**CONDITIONS THAT NEED TO BE MET:**
   
* User needs a new secure password
        
    - once button is clicked to generate it:
            
        - a series of prompts for password options will appear and user must enter the info needed for password.
                
            - prompt for length of password is at least 8 characters long and no more than 128 characters
                    
                - if user does not imput a number or enters a number less than 8 or greater than 128, user will be prompted with either: 
                        
                - "Password length must be a number. Start over"
                        
                - "Yo! That's too short! Password length must be at least 8 characters. Start over."
                    
                - user will have to start over and click the button to generate password and meet the criteria needed to generate password.
                
                - for each prompt, user will select the options (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, symbols) and will validate each option selected. 

                - In order to have a safe password, the user must select at least one of options from the prompts.
                   
                    - if user picks at least one option, prompt will be:
                        
                        - "Yeah buddy! You picked at least one option"
                    
                    - if user does not any option, prompt will be: 
                        
                        - "You need to pick at least one of the 4 options for your password. Start over."
                    
                    - if user does not pick any option, then they will need to start over and click the button again and meet the criteria needed to generate password.
                        
    - Once selection(s) have be made and met criteria for password, password is then randomly generated on display with the selection(s) the user picked.
